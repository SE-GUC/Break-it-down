Please note that there are 2 react user stories that were not merged with react_dev, located in react_dev_TasksEvents, as they are implemented using react-redux so the integration was not very synchronized together and many installs were needed in order to run these 2 user stories, implemented using react-redux, with all other code. However, I tried to fit them with the merged code but many installs were required, and it took too much time and I had to divide the submission in order to save time; I tested them on their own and they are fully functional so please review then @branch: react_dev_TasksEvents. Thank you.

Please note that we had an exception for sprint 3 deadline from Dr. Aysha as we implemented a complex feature in our backend design, along with the tests for all user stories and other backend user stories that were remaining to be done in sprint 3,  so it was kinda time consuming. The deadline was extended from 31/3/2019 to 1/4/2019, so please consider the code present just after the new deadline. Thank you.
